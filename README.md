Paper entitled ''Learning to learn ecosystems from limited data - a meta-learning approach'', submitted to PRX Life, under review. You can find it from [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07368).


Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the ''dynamical climate'' of the ecological system with limited data.

# Simulation guidance

Generate the chaotic data by running `save_chaos.py` required for the machine learning code that follows.

Run `reptile_main.py` to train the model and evaluate it on target ecological systems.
